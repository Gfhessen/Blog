Now you can use Gallery feature,
This is the code which gets transformed to gallery below, with two spaces after each line:
```
![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)  
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)  
![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)  
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)  
```

## Testing with two spaces after

![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)  
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)  
![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)  
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)  


This is the code which gets transformed to gallery below, without two spaces after each line::
```
![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)
![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)
```

## Testing without two spaces after

![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)
![_gallery <](/images/N90.jpg)
![_gallery >](/images/N90.jpg)
